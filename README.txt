My game is called ChessHuh!
ChessHuh is a place where you can play chess with your friend or against an AI
bot. If you are playing with a friend, there is a 5 minute timer you play with.

To run the project, you need the piece images in the pieceImages folder I have
and these 4 files:
- ai.py
- chess.py
- classes.py
- cmu_112_graphics.py

You must run chess.py

No external libraries needed

When you run the game, you are prompted twice in the terminal to set the white
side to a player or AI (by typing in 0 or 1) and same for the black side.

Click with your mouse on a piece, then click on the square you would like to 
move it to.

Click 'r' to restart the game
